# Satellite-Power-Communication-Subsystem-for-Space-Tug-in-LEO
Designed and simulated a Power Subsystem and SDR-based communication unit for a Space Tug in LEO. Developed PCU and SDRs with solar arrays, batteries, and distribution systems. Built a Python DOE tool for power budgets, battery life, thermal dissipation, and MPPT, supporting ADR and sustainable space missions.
