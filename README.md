# H2Z Mission ‚Äì Satellite Power & Communication Subsystem
üìå Overview
This project focuses on the design and simulation of a Power Subsystem and Software Defined Radio (SDR)-based communication unit for a CubeSat-scale Space Tug mission dedicated to Space Debris Remediation (SDR) in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).

The system integrates solar arrays, batteries, and power distribution with flexible SDR communication links. A Python-based DOE (Design of Experiment) tool was developed to perform power analysis, subsystem validation, and mission performance evaluation.

#üõ∞ Features
Power Conditioning Unit (PCU): Solar array regulation, battery charging/discharging, and load distribution.
Software Defined Radios (SDR1 & SDR2): Reconfigurable communication links for telemetry and payload interfacing.
Python DOE Tool: Models power budgets, battery sizing, thermal dissipation, and MPPT efficiency.
Subsystem Integration: Power and communication support for payloads, robotic arm, and CubeSat demonstrator.

#üîß Technologies Used
1. Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
2. Satellite EPS Design (PCU, PDU, BCR/BDR circuits)
3. Communication Systems (SDR1 & SDR2 design, S/X-band analysis)
4. Thermal & Reliability Modeling (Stefan-Boltzmann law, safety margins)

#üìä Deliverables
1. Python DOE Simulation Tool (solvers + visualization)
2. Graphs: Load curves, battery life, power margins, MPPT analysis
3. Mission presentation and technical report extracts
4. Conceptual design models for CubeSat PCU and SDR subsystems

#‚úÖ Results
1. Validated power budgets, degradation factors, and subsystem margins for mission lifetime.
2. Produced reliable end-of-life predictions for solar arrays and batteries.
3. Demonstrated robust SDR communication with redundancy and scalability for ADR missions.

#üåç Relevance
This project contributes to Active Debris Removal (ADR) technologies and sustainable space operations, supporting the long-term safety and viability of Low Earth Orbit missions.
